# College Gender Gaps
**Themes:** data visulisation

In this project, we aim to explore the gender gap across various degrees.
Starting with a fairly basic graph, we tweak it step-by-step to improve readability.
The improvements are based on the work of Edward Tufte.
The colour palette is based on Tableau's colour-blind-friendly palette available
